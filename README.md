##SOLUTION

 Solution to Room4 (The 3 previous rooms are those asked for in the PDF file. Following ones are empty.) :
The room consists of 2 parts, the left one and the right one. You want to head to the right part first as it contains 2 collectable items you will need to get through the left part, the bomb and the Running Shoes. 

First off there's a Solution folder next to this file in which contains the very sketchy idea we had of the maze we wanted to do, in case that could help one solve it. 

Here's how to get through the maze. We're going for the bomb first. Of the 3 accessible portals, take the one in the upper left corner. Then, take the portal straight ahead of you. Next, you'll want to head for the furthest possible portal, ignoring the 2 that you will eventually pass by. The next portal is the lowest one, on the left. Then, head down to find and loot the bomb. 

Next, we'll need to get the running shoes. Go back through the portal you came to this area through. Once passed, go back once more through the uppermost portal. Coming back to the 3 portals in a triangle shape, take the right one. Follow the path to the next tunnel as there is only one. The next one is tricky : you will need to step out of the portal you came out of then go back in it again. The following portal is the one you naturally come to. That should lead you to the area with the running shoes blocking your way. Take them and head through the unlocked portal to go back to the beginning.

Heading to the right part, you will want to pass the rocks. Those are controlled by the pressure plates in the area. These stay active for one second after you leave the plate. It leaves enough time for the character to get to next next area if spriting, but just not enough to get through if he's walking. The next room is quite simple, you just have to interact with a rock to place a bomb on it and watch it explode. 

You can now step in the final room to see the congratulation message and claim you've beaten the game (you sneaky little cheater ;-).
